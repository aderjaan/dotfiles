## My dotfiles
So, these are my custom bash settings. It really speeds up my development process! I am using linux, but I guess it should work for any bash environment. Will keep adding more and more tweaks as I learn.
## Installation
    git clone git://github.com/madhums/dotfiles.git dotfiles
    cd dotfiles
    ./install.sh

***Note**: Do not use it unless you understand the commands properly! I am not responsible if your dev box crashes! Use at your own risk!*
