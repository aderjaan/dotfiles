## My dotfiles
So, these are my custom bash settings. It really speeds up my development process! I am using debian, but I guess it should work for all bash environments. Will keep adding more and more tweaks as I learn and discover.
## Installation
    $ git clone git://github.com/madhums/dotfiles.git
    $ cd dotfiles
    $ ./install.sh

***Note**: Do not use it unless you understand the commands properly! I am not responsible if your dev box crashes! Use at your own risk!*
