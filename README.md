## My dotfiles
So, these are my custom bash settings. It really speeds up my development process! I am using linux, but I guess it should work for any bash environment. Will keep adding more and more tweaks as I learn.

*Note*: Do not use it unless you understand the commands properly! I am not responsible if your dev box crashes! Use at your own risk!
